![Promotional banner.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterStudioCZ/Nauru-1907/refs/heads/main/Banner.png)
**Nauru** is an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, just 53 kilometres south of the Equator. It is the third smallest sovereign country in the world, trailing behind Monaco and Vatican City. Its primary economic sectors are phosphate mining and tourism. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, with 11'680 people living there by October 2021.

**This scenario** starts in 1907, the year when the Pacific Phosphate Company began exporting locally mined phosphate. It is a 1:50 recreation of Nauru, with each tile corresponding to 50 metres. It is 128 tiles long on either side.
There are 13 settlements in total: Aiwo, Anabar, Anibare, Arenibek, Arijejen, Arubo, Baitsi, Buada, Ibwenape, Ijuw, Nibok, Ronave, and Yaren, with an initial total population of 1'764. Renewed Village Growth is used as the game script, making town expansion more difficult.
As for industries, FIRS Industries 4 was used. There is one farm, a beach, a bulk terminal, two ports, a food processing plant, 6 general stores, 5 hotels, 5 petrol stations, 2 phosphate mines, and two ports.

I hope you'll enjoy this tiny map!

## Notes
- This is not a 100% accurate recreation of Nauru. While geography should be accurate, town and industry placement might be slightly different. Additionally, this map includes features which weren't present on Nauru in 1907.
